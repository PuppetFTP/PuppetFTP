/**
 * INetworkAccessProvider:
 *   Defines the minimum requirements that a network access provider must
 *   provide. This object can operate on both side, server or client.
 *
 *   Configuration:
 *     The implementation of this interface must provide a way to configure
 *     the object as a server or as a client. Configure operation will have
 *     to create all necessary things to work. Unconfigure operation will
 *     have to release all things previously created and will have to
 *     unexposed the registered services and delete them.
 *
 *   Service management:
 *     When the network provider is configured as a server, the
 *     implementation of this interface has to exposed the given services
 *     over the network and has to managed there life cycle. For example,
 *     the CORBA implementation must register the given services on the
 *     naming services and keep the instances of the service alive.
 *
 *   Use a service from a client:
 *     When the network provider as a client, the implementation of this
 *     interface must be able to retrieve the services over the network
 *     and has to manage data transfer. The implementation is not
 *     responsible of the client life cycle.
